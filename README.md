DeepSCF
=======
The DeepSCF is a machine-learning strategy to accelerate the density functional theory (DFT) calculations by learning the map between the self-consistent field (SCF) electron density $\rho$ and the initial guess density $\rho_0$.
The DeepSCF is implemented using three-dimensional (3D) convolutional neural networks (CNNs) utilizing the U-Net architecture within the PyTorch framework.
Regrading the installation and usage of DeepSCF, detailed explanations will be provided following the publication's acceptance by the journal.
